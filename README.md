# BAM Interview

- Author: P Chong. September 2018

## Description and Objective:

- The object is to recreate the existing page for Landmark on Robson (http://landmarkonrobson.com/) in React.js up until the Residences section including Menu.
- The design is responsive for mobile and desktop

## Using:

FrontEnd:

- React

## Set Up

1. Download the repo
1. Run
   `npm install`
1. Run `npm start`

## Project Considerations

- Potential Expansion
  - While the assignment was to build just the Home page, I considered that future linked pages may also be implemented. Thus, I chose to include routing and reuseable components in this project.

## Challenges and Future Improvement

- Animations
  - This was my first project requiring extensive use of animations (incl. parallax). I spent quite a bit of the alloted time doing research on the available libraries and attempted to implement react-scroll-parallax and react-transition-groups. While some effect was achieved it was not to the level of finesse of the current Landmark page
  - I intend to look more into animations (specifically ordered animations as featured on the Hero Banner of the current Landmark page)
